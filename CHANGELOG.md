## [0.3.68] - 2026-04-17

### Migration Guide

Prefer template-first `io(template)` over `io(type, default=...)`. `default=` for `io()` remains source-compatible for now, but it is deprecated and now emits a warning.

Before:

```python
VDD = io(Power, default=Power("VDD", voltage="3.3V"))
GND = io(Ground, default=Ground("GND"))
```

After:

```python
VDD = io(Power("VDD", voltage="3.3V"))
GND = io(Ground("GND"))
```

Example warning:

```text
Warning: io() parameter `default` is deprecated; prefer template-first `io(template)` instead
    ╭─[ /Users/akhilles/src/diode/registry/reference/TCA9517Ax/TCA9517Ax.zen:46:6 ]
 46 │EN = io("EN", Net, optional=True, default=Net(VCC_A))
    │                             ╰──────────────────────── io() parameter `default` is deprecated; prefer template-first `io(template)` instead
```

Omit explicit connections for `pin.no_connect` pins. If a pin is marked `no_connect`, leave it out of `pins` and `Component()` will wire `NotConnected()` automatically.

Before:

```python
NC = io("NC", Net)

Component(
    name="J1",
    ...,
    pins={"A": A, "B": B, "NC": NC},
)
```

After:

```python
Component(
    name="J1",
    ...,
    pins={"A": A, "B": B},
)
```

Example warning:

```text
Warning: Pin 'NC' on component '1-2199119-3' is marked no_connect but was explicitly connected to Net net 'NC'; omit it from `pins` and Component() will wire NotConnected() automatically
    ╭─[ /Users/akhilles/src/dioderobot/demo/components/TE_Connectivity/1M2199119M3/1M2199119M3.zen:38:8 ]
 38 │    NC=io("NC", Net),
    │             ╰─────── Pin 'NC' on component '1-2199119-3' is marked no_connect but was explicitly connected to Net net 'NC'; omit it from `pins` and Component() will wire NotConnected() automatically
```

Avoid rebinding the same top-level name in a module. If you need to derive a final wiring choice, bind it to a new name instead of overwriting the original `io()` or intermediate value.

Before:

```python
RT = io("RT", Net)

if rt_value == "GND":
    RT = GND
elif rt_value == "VCC":
    RT = VCC
```

After:

```python
RT = io("RT", Net)

if rt_value == "GND":
    rt_pin = GND
elif rt_value == "VCC":
    rt_pin = VCC
else:
    rt_pin = RT
```

Example warning:

```text
Warning: Rebinding 'CURR_FDBK1_OPAMP_MINUS' in the same scope
    ╭─[ /Users/akhilles/src/dioderobot/demo/boards/DM0001/src/ShuntSense.zen:43:1 ]
 43 │CURR_FDBK1_OPAMP_MINUS = GND
    │           ╰─────────── Rebinding 'CURR_FDBK1_OPAMP_MINUS' in the same scope
```

Use `Power()` or `Ground()` for `io()`s that feed power pins instead of plain `Net`.

Before:

```python
VDD = io("VDD", Net)
GND = io("GND", Net)
```

After:

```python
VDD = io(Power())
GND = io(Ground())
```

Example warning:

```text
Warning: Pin 'VDD' on component 'LIS3DH' is a power pin but is connected to plain Net 'VDD'; consider using Power() or Ground()
    ╭─[ /Users/akhilles/src/dioderobot/demo/components/STMicroelectronics/LIS3DH/LIS3DH.zen:16:9 ]

    │               ╰─────── Pin 'VDD' on component 'LIS3DH' is a power pin but is connected to plain Net 'VDD'; consider using Power() or Ground()
```

Migrate deprecated `generics/Diode.zen` usage to the more specific diode generics:

- Use `generics/Rectifier.zen` for standard and Schottky diodes, including small-signal / signaling diodes.
- Use `generics/Zener.zen` for reverse-breakdown regulation and reference diodes.
- Use `generics/Tvs.zen` for transient-voltage suppressors.

Package mapping:

```text
SMA -> DO-214AC
SMB -> DO-214AA
SMC -> DO-214AB
SOD-123 / SOD-323 / SOD-523 stay the same
```

Rectifier / Schottky:

```python
Diode(package="SMA", variant="Schottky", v_r="40V", i_f="1A", v_f="500mV", A=A, K=K)
Rectifier(package="DO-214AC", technology="Schottky", reverse_voltage="40V", forward_current="1A", forward_voltage="500mV", A=A, K=K)
```

Zener:

```python
Diode(package="SOD-123", variant="Zener", v_r="5.1V", A=A, K=K)
Zener(package="SOD-123", zener_voltage="5.1V", A=A, K=K)
```

TVS:

```python
Tvs(package="DO-214AA", direction="Unidirectional", reverse_standoff_voltage="24V", reverse_clamping_voltage="38.9V", peak_pulse_power="3000W", A=GND, K=VIN)
```

### Added

- `pcb build` now accept repeatable `--config key=value` for setting `config()` parameters.
- Net type physical-value fields now coerce string and scalar inputs like `io()`/`config()`.
- Unnamed `Net()`/typed nets and generated interface child nets now infer names from assignment targets when possible.
- Add `io()` direction metadata plus `input()` / `output()` sugar.
- `config()`, `io()`, `input()`, and `output()` now allow omitting the explicit name when assigned to a top-level variable.
- `config()` now supports discrete `allowed=` sets for scalar and physical-value inputs.

- Added style advice for redundant explicit names on `io()`, `config()`, nets, and interfaces.
- Add pass-based schematic ERC plumbing and net-site `pin.no_connect` diagnostics with inline suppression support.
- `io(template)` now infers placeholder types and enforces typed-net voltage compatibility.

### Changed

- Component generation no longer automatically scans datasheets.
- Component modifiers can now override `spice_model`.
- House Murata caps now use vendor MLCC models when available.
- `voltage_within()` now accepts nets with voltage metadata or direct `Voltage` values.
- `pcb new component` and `pcb search` component imports now place datasheet artifacts under each component's `docs/` subdirectory.
- Layout sync and KiCad netlist export now normalize file- and package-based footprints to library-aware FPIDs.
- `Component()` now infers `spice_model` from symbol `Sim.*` properties.
- `Simulation()` now accepts `bom_profile=`.
- Module-scoped variable rebinding is now a warning.
- Removed the 10uF 100V 1210 stdlib house capacitor from generic matching due to severe derating.
- `Net` and `Power` now expose unset `voltage` as `None`.
- Deprecated `NET=` net casts now warn; use positional forms like `Power(other_net)`.
- Remove legacy `pcb fork` subcommands and reserve `pcb fork` for future use.

### Fixed

- LSP diagnostics now publish to the `.zen` file that owns the root diagnostic span.

## [0.3.67] - 2026-04-10

### Added

- Added workspace-scoped Diode endpoint overrides via `[workspace].endpoint`, with auth tokens stored per resolved endpoint.

### Changed

- Loading deprecated stdlib physical-unit `*Range` aliases now emits a deprecation warning pointing to the corresponding base unit type.
- Deprecated the stdlib `pins.zen` and `metadata.zen` modules.
- Deprecated the `Schematics()` helper.
- Deprecated generic modules `generics/Bjt.zen`, `generics/Diode.zen`, `generics/Mosfet.zen`, and `generics/OperationalAmplifier.zen`.
- Deprecated non-standard packages in `generics/Inductor.zen`.
- Newly added KiCad symbol properties now default to `justify left top` and `hide yes`.
- `pcb scan` now resolves local PDFs through the shared datasheet materialization cache by default, and `--output` copies the materialized Markdown and images out of that cache.
- `pcb scan` now prints both `PDF:` and `Markdown:` output paths, with local PDF scans reporting the original input PDF path and URL scans reporting the materialized cached PDF path.
- `pcb search` now merges docs full-text results for registry packages and KiCad symbols, with consistent phrase handling across indices.

### Fixed

- `pcb build --offline` now reuses selected locked pseudo-versions for rev-pinned workspace deps.
- `PhysicalValue` is now hashable in Starlark, including after freezing.
- Layout sync no longer creates empty footprint `(embedded_files)` blocks that KiCad removes on save.

## [0.3.66] - 2026-04-06

## [0.3.65] - 2026-04-03

### Added

- Added 10uF 100V 1210 house capacitor in stdlib

### Fixed

- `pcb layout` no longer crashes when a managed component path is numeric-only, such as `1053091102`.
- `pcb build` now warns and drops invalid inherited symbol datasheet paths instead of failing the build.

## [0.3.64] - 2026-04-02

### Added

- Added support for KiCad 10.

## [0.3.63] - 2026-03-30

### Changed

- KiCad symbol is now the source of truth for component metadata (footprint, datasheet, part); generated `.zen` files are minimal wrappers.
- `Component()` inherits `skip_bom` from the KiCad symbol `in_bom` flag (inverted) when not explicitly set.
- `pcb fork add` is now blocked and points users to `pcb sandbox`; `pcb fork remove` and `pcb fork upstream` remain for existing forks.

### Added

- Warn when module `io()`s are declared but never connected to any realized ports.

### Fixed

- Stdlib `Crystal` and `MountingHole` no longer expose unused variant-specific ports.
- Untagged `branch`/`rev` dependencies now use `0.1.1-0...` pseudo-versions so they outrank plain `0.1.0` deps.

## [0.3.62] - 2026-03-27

### Fixed

- `pcb doc --package <url>` now defaults remote packages to the latest tagged version and accepts an explicit `@latest` suffix.

## [0.3.61] - 2026-03-25

### Added

- `pcb new component` now prints a `Module("...")` usage hint when it can infer a qualified URL.

### Fixed

- Auto-deps now only upgrades synced workspace member dependency versions.
- Workspace-namespace dependencies now fail locally with a clear missing-member error instead of remote fetch fallback.

## [0.3.60] - 2026-03-25

### Added

- Board publish now blocks outside CI when any `pcb.toml` uses `[patch]` or `branch`/`rev` dependencies.

### Changed

- Show `Fetching <repo>` progress while populating shared bare repos under `~/.pcb/bare`.
- Vendored remote packages now copy only canonical package files instead of whole cache directories.

### Fixed

- Git HTTPS fallback probes now run non-interactively before falling back to SSH.
- Exclude `pcb.sum` in canonical package hash
- LSP now watches `**/pcb.toml` and `**/pcb.sum` for dependency and workspace updates.
- Auto-deps now sync workspace member versions against tags reachable from the current `HEAD`, avoiding version bumps from future history on historical checkouts.

## [0.3.59] - 2026-03-23

### Added

- `pcb search` now supports `kicad:components` in both the TUI and non-interactive search.

### Changed

- Dependency materialization now archives directly from `~/.pcb/bare` for tagged and pinned dependencies.

### Fixed

- Existing partial bare repos under `~/.pcb/bare` now transparently hydrate to full clones before serving pinned local commits.

## [0.3.58] - 2026-03-21

### Added

- `Usb2TypeC` interface adapter in stdlib to connet USB2 to TypeC
- `Dvp` interface for cameras with 8, 10, 12 and 16 bit width
- `SdRam` interface for 16 bit and 32 bit

### Changed

- `pcb publish` for packages now builds before planning publish waves and aborts if the validation build dirties the repository.

### Fixed

- `pcb update` now consistently scopes nested paths to the containing package.
- Branch and `rev` dependencies now resolve the pseudo-version matching the pinned commit, avoiding flaky `pcb.sum` entries.

## [0.3.57] - 2026-03-18

### Added

- `pcb publish` now supports inferred package bumps from conventional commits with `--bump=infer`.
- `pcb publish -y` now skips the final package publish confirmation prompt.
- Include version in dependency/dependent URLs in search results (e.g. `...@1.0`).

### Changed

- All `@stdlib/kicad/` modules (`PinHeader`, `PinSocket`, `MolexPicoBlade`, `SolderWire`, `TagConnect`) now emit deprecation warnings.
- `pcb publish` now fetches remote state before preflight checks and verifies local main is in sync with the remote.
- `pcb publish` for packages now requires the `CI` environment variable to be set (use `--force` or `CI=true` to bypass).
- Skill setup and instructions now live in `pcb ai` instead of the main `pcb` CLI and MCP server.

### Fixed

- `pcb publish` now generates shorter conventional commit titles for dependency bumps.
- `pcb publish` now rolls back local tags and commits if pushing to remote fails.

## [0.3.56] - 2026-03-14

### Fixed

- Reject same-package package URLs in `Module()` and require relative paths instead of adding self-dependencies.

## [0.3.55] - 2026-03-14

### Fixed

- Stop syncing `Alternatives` and `Matcher` component metadata into KiCad footprint fields during layout sync.
- `pcb bom` now keeps MOQ-expensive offers in BOM output but marks them hard to source in table summaries instead of dropping them.

## [0.3.54] - 2026-03-12

### Added

- Hidden `pcb kq` command to inspect KiCad symbol libraries as structured JSON views (`sym`, `metadata`, `electrical`, `raw`).
- `pcb new component --component-id <id>` now installs a web-searched component non-interactively, with optional `--part-number` fallback and `--manufacturer` override/fallback.
- `[[workspace.kicad_library]]` now supports `parts = "<url>"`, materializing a virtual parts manifest for KiCad symbol repos so `@kicad-symbols/...` symbols can inherit default parts too.

### Changed

- CLI and MCP component search JSON outputs are now aligned, with cleaner payloads and per-source caps for `web:components`.

### Fixed

- `pcb publish` now shows `patch`, `minor`, and `major` bumps for boards consistently, and `major` on `0.x` now produces `1.0.0`.

## [0.3.53] - 2026-03-11

### Added

- `pcb new workspace` now creates an empty `pcb.sum`, so `pcb build --locked --offline` works immediately.
- `pcb scan` now accepts `http(s)` datasheet URLs in addition to local PDF paths and prints the resolved markdown path.
- `Part` is now in the standard library prelude. Use `Part(mpn=..., manufacturer=...)` with `Component(part=...)` for manufacturer sourcing.
- `pcb doc --install` writes embedded documentation to `~/.pcb/docs`; runs automatically on first use and after `pcb self update`.
- `Component()` now inherits default `part`, `alternatives`, and part qualifications from manifest `parts` entries matched by stable `package://` symbol URIs.

### Changed

- `Part` is now the single source of truth for component sourcing. `mpn` and `manufacturer` on `Component()` still work but `part=` is preferred.
- `pcb new` now uses subcommands (`workspace`, `board`, `package`, `component`) instead of `--workspace/--board/--package/--component` flags.
- `pcb new component [DIR]` now imports local component directories; `pcb search --dir` support was removed.
- `Net` is now defined in `@stdlib/interfaces.zen` and available via the stdlib prelude instead of being a language builtin.
- Removed deprecated backward-compatibility shims: `builtin.physical_range()`, `builtin.Voltage`/`Current`/etc. attributes, `using()`.
- `pcb scan` removed `--model` and `--json`; local PDF and URL flows now both resolve to markdown output with default processing.

### Fixed

- `match_component()` now skips non-component children such as `ElectricalCheck` instead of failing on missing `mpn`.
- `pcb update` no longer proposes updates for KiCad asset libraries (symbols, footprints, 3D models) which publish breaking changes in patch releases.
- Auto-dependency detection now resolves relative path imports that cross workspace member boundaries (e.g. `load("../../modules/Lib/Lib.zen", ...)`).
- Layout sync now applies pad assignments to all same-number KiCad pad objects in a footprint.

## [0.3.52] - 2026-03-07

### Added

- `config()` now supports `checks` parameter for validation functions, matching `io()`.
- Stdlib prelude: `Power`, `Ground`, `NotConnected`, `Layout`, and `Board` are now implicitly available in `.zen` files without explicit `load()` statements.

### Changed

- `config()` parameter `convert` is now deprecated and emits a warning.
- Bundle the standard library with `pcb` and make it available automatically in each workspace.

### Fixed

- Preserve KiCad zone priorities during `layout.sync` and bias fragment zones so overlapping fills keep the intended precedence.

## [0.3.51] - 2026-03-04

### Changed

- Bump stdlib to 0.5.11

### Added

- Added typed part metadata with `builtin.Part(...)` and `Component(part=...)`, including JSON netlist serialization and `list[Part]` support for `properties["alternatives"]`.

### Fixed

- Apply MVS-selected KiCad asset versions in resolution/materialization and sibling promotion, preventing `@kicad-*` alias failures after patch updates.
- `pcb update` now ignores prerelease dependency versions when selecting updates.

## [0.3.50] - 2026-03-02

### Changed

- Bump stdlib to 0.5.10

### Fixed

- `pcb publish` now skips tracked paths from regular manifest dependencies and correctly copies tracked asset directories, fixing release staging failures on patched/forked module layouts.

## [0.3.49] - 2026-03-02

### Changed

- Replace `[assets]` with `[[workspace.kicad_library]]` for built-in resolution of KiCad symbol, footprint, and 3D model repositories.
- Embed referenced 3D models directly into `.kicad_pcb` layout files, eliminating the need for external 3D model files at layout time.

## [0.3.48] - 2026-02-28

### Added

- `pcb simulate`: run SPICE simulations directly via ngspice with inline `set_sim_setup()`, `--netlist`/`-o -` output, workspace discovery, and LSP diagnostics on save. Errors on components missing a `SpiceModel` to prevent incomplete netlists.
- Support net names in f-strings for SPICE simulation setup (e.g. `f"V1 {VIN} {GND} AC 1"`), including dot-notation for interface nets (`{POWER.vcc}`).

### Fixed

- Normalize net and component symbol source paths to `package://...`, so emitted schematic/netlist `symbol_path` values no longer leak absolute cache paths.

## [0.3.47] - 2026-02-27

### Fixed

- Ensure `File()` footprint paths resolve to `package://...` when dependency files are read from `~/.pcb/cache`.

## [0.3.46] - 2026-02-26

### Changed

- Use zstd level 17 (was 15) when embedding STEP 3D models into KiCad footprints.
- `Path(..., allow_not_exist=True)` no longer emits missing-path warnings.
- `pcb search` component add now prefers symbol datasheets, using fallback URL scan only when needed.
- `pcb search` add-component now rewrites symbol `Manufacturer_Part_Number`/`Manufacturer_Name` metadata before generating `.zen`.

### Fixed

- Normalize netlist `package_roots` cache paths to `<workspace>/.pcb/cache` for unvendored remote dependencies (including stdlib).
- MCP `resolve_datasheet` now avoids top-level JSON Schema combinators in `inputSchema`, fixing strict MCP clients (e.g., Claude Code) that reject `oneOf` at schema root.

## [0.3.45] - 2026-02-25

### Added

- Added `pcb doc` guides for bringup, changelog, and readme conventions.
- Added MCP tool `resolve_datasheet` to produce cached `datasheet.md` + `images/` from `datasheet_url`, `pdf_path`, or `kicad_sym_path`.
- Added LSP request `pcb/resolveDatasheet`, sharing the same resolve flow as the MCP tool.

### Fixed

- Standalone `.zen` files with inline manifests now map `Board(..., layout_path=...)` to `package://workspace/...`, avoiding absolute-path leakage.
- Stackup sync now emits dielectric `(type ...)` once per grouped layer (not per `addsublayer`), preventing spurious `layout.sync` drift.

## [0.3.44] - 2026-02-20

### Added

- `Component()` now infers missing `footprint` from symbol `Footprint` (`<stem>` or KiCad `<lib>:<fp>`), reducing duplicated footprint data over `.kicad_sym`.

### Changed

- MCP external tool discovery now prefers `mcp --code-mode=false` (raw tools) and falls back to `mcp` only when needed, avoiding nested code-mode wrappers for compatible `pcb-*` backends.

### Fixed

- Reduced `layout.sync` false positives in publish/check flows by normalizing `.kicad_pro` newline writes and ignoring trailing whitespace-only drift when comparing synced layout files.
- Simplified dependency fetch/index concurrency paths and reuse a shared cache index during resolve/fetch phases to reduce open-file pressure on macOS.
- Auto-deps is now conservative and online-only: it adds remote deps only after successful materialization, skips imports already covered by existing `dependencies`/`assets`, and no longer infers missing deps from `pcb.sum`.
- Branch-based dependencies now require commit pinning for reproducibility: online resolve/update pins `branch` deps to `rev`, while `--locked`/`--offline` reject branch-only declarations.
- Fixed dotted pin-name handling by resolving port owners with longest-prefix component matching in netlist/layout/publish flows.

## [0.3.43] - 2026-02-18

### Added

- `pcb import` now imports KiCad design rules (including solder-mask/zone defaults), copies sibling `.kicad_dru`, and prints the generated board `.zen` path.
- `pcb fmt` now formats KiCad S-expression files when given explicit file paths.

### Changed

- Bump stdlib to 0.5.9
- `pcb layout --check` now runs layout sync against a shadow copy.
- Removed `--sync-board-config`; board config sync is now always enabled for layout sync (CLI, MCP `run_layout`, and `pcb_layout::process_layout`).
- Stackup/layers patching in `pcb layout` now uses structural S-expression mutation + canonical KiCad-style formatting, with unconditional patch/write.
- `pcb layout` stackup sync now also patches `general (thickness ...)` from computed stackup thickness.
- Removed MCP resource `zener-docs` (https://docs.pcb.new/llms.txt) from `pcb mcp`, with Zener docs now embedded in `pcb doc`.
- Move board-config/title-block patching to Rust; simplify Python sync; only update `.kicad_pro` netclass patterns when assignments exist.
- `pcb search` now formats generated component `.kicad_sym` and `.kicad_mod` files with the KiCad S-expression formatter.
- `pcb search` now rewrites imported symbol `property "Footprint"` to the local `lib:footprint` form (`<stem>:<stem>`), matching fp-lib-table resolution during layout sync.
- `pcb search` now fails fast unless imported `.kicad_sym` contains exactly one symbol.

### Fixed

- Standardized KiCad unnamed-pin handling: empty/placeholder names now fall back to pin numbers in both import and runtime symbol loading, fixing `Unknown pin name` errors for imported components.
- KiCad symbol variant parsing now selects one style per unit using named-pin coverage (tie: lowest style index), avoiding pin-name overrides while supporting `_N_0` symbols.

## [0.3.42] - 2026-02-13

### Changed

- `config()` physical-value coercion now accepts numeric scalars (`int`/`float`) in addition to strings, matching constructor behavior.
- `config()` now enforces required module inputs: `optional=False` emits an error diagnostic even when `default` is set; omitted `optional` infers from `default`.
- Bump stdlib to 0.5.8

### Fixed

- Fix `package://` resolution for workspace and versioned dependencies, preventing absolute path leakage from `File()`.

## [0.3.41] - 2026-02-12

### Fixed

- Harden `pcb import` passive value parsing (e.g. `1 uF`, `2,2uF`, `1uF/16V`, `10 kΩ`, `R10`) so generic R/C auto-promotion is applied consistently.

## [0.3.40] - 2026-02-12

### Added

- `load()` and `Module()` with relative paths can now cross package boundaries within a workspace, resolved through the dependency system.

### Fixed

- `pcb publish` now works when run from a board directory with a relative `.zen` path (e.g., `pcb publish DM0002.zen`).

### Changed

- Resolve `Path()` and `File()` to stable relative paths for machine-independent build artifacts. 
- Bump stdlib to 0.5.7
- `pcb import` now scaffolds a full workspace (git init, README, .gitignore) when the output directory is new, matching `pcb new --workspace`.

## [0.3.39] - 2026-02-11

### Fixed

- Layout discovery now uses only `.kicad_pro` files, ignoring extra `.kicad_pcb` files in the layout directory.

## [0.3.38] - 2026-02-11

### Added

- `pcb release` now includes `drc.json` in the release archive containing the full KiCad DRC report.
- `pcb import <project.kicad_pro> <output_dir>` to generate a Zener board from a KiCad project.

### Changed

- KiCad layout discovery no longer assumes `layout.kicad_pcb`; it now discovers a single top-level `.kicad_pro` (preferred) or `.kicad_pcb` in the layout directory and errors on ambiguity.

## [0.3.37] - 2026-02-09

### Added

- Reference designator assignment now opportunistically honors unambiguous hierarchical path hints (e.g. `foo.R22.part`).
- `pcb:sch` comments now support optional `mirror=x|y`, and netlist `instances.*.symbol_positions.*` now serializes `mirror` when set.

### Fixed

- Improved LSP file change syncing to prevent spurious diagnostics.

## [0.3.36] - 2026-02-06

### Fixed

- On layout sync, detach all items from removed KiCad groups before deleting the group to avoid `SaveBoard` crashes from stale group handles.

## [0.3.35] - 2026-02-06

### Added

- `pcb new --board` now generates `README.md` and `CHANGELOG.md` files from templates
- `pcb new --package` now generates `README.md` and `CHANGELOG.md` files from templates

### Changed

- Bump stdlib to 0.5.6
- `pcb update <path>` limits updates to a single workspace package when `<path>` points to that package directory.
- Reference designator auto-assignment now uses natural sorting of hierarchical instance names (e.g., `R2` before `R10`).
- Drop support for v1 workspaces

### Fixed

- Stabilize auto-named single-port `NotConnected()` net names (e.g., `NC_R1_P2`) to reduce layout implicit renames.
- Layout sync: explode single-pin multi-pad `NotConnected` nets into per-pad `unconnected-(...)` nets.
- Accept KiCad copper role `jumper` when importing stackups.
- IPC-2581 rev B: parse `FunctionMode` `level` attribute as numeric.
- Restoring missing KiCad groups no longer triggers fragment placement that can move existing footprints.

## [0.3.34] - 2026-02-03

### Added

- `pcb preview <path/to/board.zen>` to generate a preview link for a release.

### Changed

- Board release gerber exports now use Gerber X2 format.
- Board release drill exports now generate separate PTH/NPTH Excellon files and both PDF + GerberX2 drill maps.

### Fixed

- Restore `NotConnected` compatibility: keep normal connectivity (no per-pad net exploding), warn when it connects multiple pins, and only mark pads `no_connect` for single-pin cases.

## [0.3.33] - 2026-02-03

### Changed

- `PhysicalValue` now formats symmetric tolerances as `10k 5%` (instead of `min–max (nominal nom.)`).

## [0.3.32] - 2026-02-02

### Changed

- Unify physical value and range types (e.g. VoltageRange is just an alias to Voltage)
- Deduplicate pin names when generating component .zen file

## [0.3.31] - 2026-02-01

### Added

- `config()` now auto-converts strings to PhysicalValue/PhysicalRange types (e.g., `voltage = "3.3V"`)

### Fixed

- `io()` default values now correctly apply net type promotion (e.g., `default=NotConnected()` promotes to the expected net type)

## [0.3.30] - 2026-02-01

### Added

- Warning for unnamed nets that fall back to auto-assigned `N{id}` names
- NotConnected nets now preserve their type in schematics and can be passed to any net type parameter

### Added

- `pcb publish <path/to/board.zen>` to publish a board release

### Removed

- `pcb tag` and `pcb release` are no longer supported. Use `pcb publish <path/to/board.zen>` instead.

### Changed

- Bump stdlib to 0.5.3

## [0.3.27] - 2026-01-23

### Added

- Post-sync detection of stale `moved()` paths that weren't renamed

### Changed

- Deterministic diagnostic ordering during parallel module evaluation
- `moved()` directives are now skipped if the target path already exists in the layout
- `moved()` now requires at least one path to be a direct child (depth 1)
- `pcb publish` now uses single confirmation prompt instead of two
- `pcb release` now works for boards without a layout directory
- `pcb layout` now auto-detects implicit net renames and patches zones/vias before sync

### Fixed

- Validate that member packages do not have `[workspace]` sections during workspace discovery
- `pcb new --board` and `pcb new --package` no longer generate `[workspace]` sections in pcb.toml
- `pcb update` now correctly respects interactive selection for breaking changes
- `pcb release` now correctly identifies the board package when workspace root has dependencies
- `copy_dir_all` now skips hidden files/directories to prevent copying `.pcb/`, `.git/`, etc.

## [0.3.26] - 2026-01-20

### Changed

- Bump stdlib to 0.5.1
- Standardize CLI: `build`/`test`/`fmt` take optional `[PATH]`, `layout`/`bom`/`sim`/`open`/`route`/`release` require `<FILE>`

## [0.3.25] - 2026-01-19

### Added

- Add `pcb mcp eval` to execute JavaScript with MCP tools (also exposed as `execute_tools` MCP tool)
- Add `pcb run add-skill` to install the pcb skill into any git repository
- Add V2 dependency resolution support to `pcb sim` (adds `--offline` and `--locked` flags)
- Add `pcb search --mode` to specify starting mode (`registry:modules`, `registry:components`, `web:components`)
- Add availability, pricing, offers to `pcb search`, `pcb bom -f json`, MCP tools

### Changed

- `pcb layout` now displays sync diagnostics (orphaned zones/vias, moved path warnings) even without `--check`
- Zones/vias referencing deleted nets are now unassigned instead of heuristically reassigned; use `moved()` for intentional net renames
- Change `pcb search --json` to `pcb search -f json` for consistency with other commands
- Rename `pcb search` TUI modes: `registry` → `registry:modules`/`registry:components`, `new` → `web:components`

### Removed

- Remove `--add` flag from `pcb search`
- Remove unused `pcb bom --rules` flag

### Fixed

- Fix `pcb layout` group splitting regression where running layout twice would cause module groups to split into two (one with footprints, one with tracks/zones)
- Fix race condition when populating dependency cache

## [0.3.24] - 2026-01-14

### Added

- `pcb release` now generates a canonical `netlist.json` in the release staging directory

## [0.3.23] - 2026-01-13

### Added

- Add `pcb doc --package <pkg> --list` to list .zen files in a package as a tree
- Add subpath filtering for `pcb doc --package` (e.g., `@stdlib/generics` filters to generics/)

### Changed

- Bump stdlib to 0.4.10
- MCP `search_registry` tool now returns workspace-relative cache paths when run inside a workspace

### Removed

- Remove stdlib hijacking from evaluator. The toolchain now relies on the pinned stdlib version instead of replacing types at runtime.

### Fixed

### Changed

- Refactor layout sync to use a groups registry (virtual DOM pattern) as source of truth instead of querying KiCad directly

### Removed

- Remove `get_zener_docs` MCP tool (use `pcb doc` CLI command instead)
- Remove `pcb search --legacy` flag and the old interactive API search. Use the default TUI-based registry search instead.
- Remove `pcb clean` command. To recover from cache issues, manually delete files in `~/.pcb`.
- Remove `fab_drawing.html` from release artifacts (replaced by IPC-2581 HTML export)
- Remove `docs/` directory from release staging output

- `pcb layout` now auto-replaces footprints when FPID changes (preserving position and nets)
- Speed up workspace discovery by pruning unrelated directories

### Fixed

- Fix `pcb layout --check` only reporting first extra footprint instead of all
- Fix inconsistent handling of invalid pcb.toml files between `pcb build` and `pcb publish`
- Fix fp-lib-table in release staging to use vendored paths instead of .pcb/cache
- Create `<workspace>/.pcb/cache` symlink pointing to `~/.pcb/cache` for stable paths

## [0.3.20] - 2026-01-09

### Added
